# PHY-397-Assignment
A Practical exam of PHY 397(Scientific Computing) given by @https://github.com/jeffjay88 as the lecturer for the course.
<h1> Background </h1>
<p1> <strong> Computational physics </strong> is a branch of physics that uses computational methods and algorithms to study physical systems. It involves the development and application of numerical algorithms to solve physical problems that are difficult or impossible to solve analytically. In the given task,the use of numerical methods and algorithms to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional potential well was required. This is a classic example of a problem in computational physics that requires the use of numerical methods to obtain a solution. </p1> <br>
<p2>Some of the objectives for this task were:
<ol> 
<li> Understand the basics of computational physics and numerical methods </li>
<li> Learn how to solve the resulting eigenvalue problem using the numpy library in Python </li>
<li> Investigate the effect of the well width and barrier height on the energy eigenvalues and wavefunctions of the particle </li>
<li> Use the matplotlib library to plot the energy eigenvalues and wavefunctions as a function of well width and barrier height. Also,interpret the results obtained and discuss their physical significance </li>
</ol>
</p2>

<h1>Method and Results </h1>
imported as a file.

<h1> Conclusion </h1>
<p1>This code uses the finite difference method to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional potential well with a piecewise potential energy function. It provides an intuitive way of visualizing the energy eigenvalues and wavefunctions for different well widths and barrier heights, and allows us to calculate the energy gap between different energy levels and the probability distribution of the wavefunction. </p1>

<h1>Recommendation(s)</h1>
<p1>Python has a vast collection of libraries, and students should learn about the most commonly used ones, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. Also understanding of some of their in-built functions and their usage.
